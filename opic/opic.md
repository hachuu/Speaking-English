## 오피AL 국내여행 (1)
```
I love travelling to Gangwon Province.
The place is well known for being undeveloped, and having a clean, natural environment. 
The main reason I enjoy going there is that it is such a beautiful place. 
Another good thing is that there are many things to do and many things to see.
I can't wait to head back there. 
I still have a vivid picture of it.
I wish I could return to that moment.

## 음식 관련 3단 콤보 문제
```
Last weekend, I went to the restaurant with some friends.
We ordered some black pork barbecue which is one of my favorites.
It's quite different from the ordinary Korean port belly barbecue.
The meat is jucier, it tastes richer. We pigged out.
Plus, They grilled the meat so well.
Knowing how to grill is literally one of the most important parts of cooking.
They are obviously experts in Korean barbecue. Everything was so perfect.
We had a great time there.
I highly recommend anyone who likes Korean barbecue to visit the place
