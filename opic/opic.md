## 오피AL 국내여행 (1)
```
I love travelling to Gangwon Province.
The place is well known for being undeveloped, and having a clean, natural environment. 
The main reason I enjoy going there is that it is such a beautiful place. 
Another good thing is that there are many things to do and many things to see.
I can't wait to head back there. 
I still have a vivid picture of it.
I wish I could return to that moment.

## 음식 관련 3단 콤보 문제
```
Last weekend, I went to the restaurant with some friends.
We ordered some black pork barbecue which is one of my favorites.
It's quite different from the ordinary Korean port belly barbecue.
The meat is jucier, it tastes richer. We pigged out.
Plus, They grilled the meat so well.
Knowing how to grill is literally one of the most important parts of cooking.
They are obviously experts in Korean barbecue. Everything was so perfect.
We had a great time there.
I highly recommend anyone who likes Korean barbecue to visit the place

## 은행 3단 콤보
- Problems can occur when you are at the bank. Perhaps you could have forgotten to take your ID with you. Talk about a problem you personally had at a bank. How did you solve that problem?
```
I had to go to a bank to get a new One Time Passcode/Pin card a few days ago, because I lost it.
We need the card to transfer money on a mobile banking app.
Whenever I do that they require the random number shown on my OTP card.
Actually I got the card just a week ago, but I couldn't find it.
It will probably turn up in my bedroom sometime soon.
It's so small that I easily lose it. That's always annoying.
It was raining outside and the nearest bank was under construction, so I had to go quite far away. When I finally got to the other bank it was pretty crowded.
I got the ticket and waited for my number to be called for like half an hour.
After that I told the bank teller why I came here and she was like,
'There's $3 additional fee to reissue your OTP. You can only pay in cash.' Oh my god. I didn't have any cash at the time.
We hardly have cash (or take cash with us),
because we all use debit or credit cards these days, you know.
It was such a disaster.
I ended up coming back home with nothing done.
I didn't feel like going back so I just gave up and I got it a week later.
This was one of my terrible experiences at a bank
