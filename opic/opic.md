I love traveling to Busan.
The place is well known for being well developed, and having many tourist attractions. 
The main reason I enjoy going there is that it is such an interesting place. 
Another good thing is that there are many things to do and many things to see.
I can't wait to head back there. I still have a vivid picture of it.
I wish I could return to that moment.
